# Changelog

## 1.0.0.13

- Replace the unsafe owned-retainer confirmation click that caused repeatable native FFXIV crashes with the complete event payload used by Marketbuddy, after the comparison window is fully closed and settled.
- Enter exact owned-retainer match prices through the game's numeric price control and verify item, retainer, quality, entered price, and saved price before continuing.
- Detect and ignore the entire suspicious low-price cluster behind a 1-gil listing (for example, `1, 5, 10,000` uses `10,000`). Use the logical market above the discontinuity, or leave the item unchanged when no safe reference exists.

## 1.0.0.12

- Include owned-retainer price mismatches in the adjustment plan even when Allagan Market does not paint the current listing red.
- Make Adjust Undercut Pricing verify every active listing directly, so a `675` gil listing reliably matches another owned retainer's market-lowest `323` gil listing.
- Preserve external-seller priority whenever an external listing is cheaper, never raise prices, and avoid redundant updates when owned duplicates already match.

## 1.0.0.11

- Match a lower price from another owned retainer exactly when that owned listing is currently the market-lowest listing.
- Keep external sellers on the existing Marketbuddy undercut rule and never raise a listing that is already lower.
- Verify the exact saved price before continuing and identify owned-retainer matches separately in the run report.

## 1.0.0.10

- Enforce a safe minimum interval between market-board comparison requests so FFXIV does not reject overlapping searches with “Please wait and try your search again.”
- Detect that game response, close the incomplete comparison safely, back off, and retry the same listing instead of accepting stale data or eventually timing out.

## 1.0.0.9

- Removed the invalid market-search identity gate that rejected a fully loaded second result window when FFXIV cleared its transient search ID.
- Validate the selected item against the returned listings themselves and fall back to the visible prices, HQ status, and retainer names if FFXIV has already released its backing search data.

## 1.0.0.8

- Read market results from FFXIV's global Item Search data instead of the transient Item Search agent pointer, which becomes unavailable after the first Marketbuddy comparison.
- Prevented the resulting 2/20 timeout while preserving owned-retainer exclusion and exact HQ/NQ filtering.

## 1.0.0.7

- Fixed repeated 2/20 scan stalls on Aurum Regis Rapier by reading the active Retainer agent's selected inventory slot instead of the stale Blocked Items cache.
- Cross-check the selected listing against the completed market search and repair a stale item identity before ownership and HQ/NQ filtering.
- Split market-search identity waits from ownership waits so future failures identify the actual unavailable state.

## 1.0.0.6

- Shifted the retainer market toolbar controls 48 pixels back to the left for a better-balanced placement.
- Fixed Auto Check/Adjust timing out after the first listing when the game's owned-retainer cache briefly disappears between searches.
- Read the selected listing directly from the Adjust Price window so item identity, HQ/NQ quality, slot, name, and price cannot drift from the visible row.
- Check every visible retainer row in one top-to-bottom pass and retain ownership-aware highlighting by the exact retainer row.

## 1.0.0.5

- Prevented a player's retainers from undercutting one another by excluding every owned retainer from the competitor list.
- Ownership-aware highlighting no longer leaves a listing red merely because a matching listing on another owned retainer is cheaper.
- Added item, quality, ownership, saved-price, and final-price validation before any adjustment can advance.
- Duplicate listings now use the same cheapest external competitor instead of cascading through the player's own prices.
- Added a persistent last-run report with old, competitor, and final prices plus an outcome for every adjustment.
- Added per-item synchronization guards for Allagan Market and retainer inventory updates.
- Moved the retainer toolbar controls approximately two inches to the right.

## 1.0.0.4

- Prevent stale empty market data from being mistaken for a competitor disappearing during adjustment.
- Recheck Allagan Market after an empty result and retry listings that remain red.
- Report bounded adjustment failures explicitly instead of incorrectly counting them as competitor-free.

## 1.0.0.3

- Fixed checks stalling when identical items appear in consecutive retainer slots.
- Accept populated market rows immediately even when the game's duplicate-search flag does not reset correctly.
- Query each unique item and quality combination once, then verify every matching retainer row for undercuts.
- Give Allagan Market a balanced observation interval before closing and classifying each result.

## 1.0.0.2

- Wait for the game's definitive market-response state before deciding that a listing has no competitors.
- Inspect every retainer row, including scrolled-off rows, before adjusting undercuts.
- Speed up normal checking and repricing steps while retaining verified window transitions.
- Replace the three oversized toolbar labels with compact icon buttons and descriptive hover help.

## 1.0.0.1

- Treat an empty market comparison as a successful undercut check instead of waiting until timeout.
- Leave a listing unchanged and continue safely if its competitors disappear before the adjustment pass.

## 1.0.0.0

- Added retainer-list controls for checking undercuts, adjusting confirmed undercuts, and running both steps together.
- Integrated Allagan Market's red undercut state and Marketbuddy's existing pricing behavior.
- Added dependency status and installation controls for Marketbuddy and Allagan Market.
- Added guarded window transitions, timeouts, progress status, cancellation, and chat summaries.
